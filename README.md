## VIOLET BLOOM theme by Midifreakz.

Combined elements of the Epic Noir theme and the CRT theme to create a truely modern and aestheticly pleasing experience across Emulation Station.
Heavily focused on console & controller and logo nostalgia.



EPIC NOIR:

CRT THEME:
Originally based on the Carbon theme by Eric Hettervik; and then rebuilt by Alphatoanant.
