Combined elements of the Epic Noir theme and the CRT theme to create a truely modern and aestheticly pleasing experience across Emulation Station.
Heavily focused on console & controller and logo nostalgia.



EPIC NOIR:
Original ideas by Chicuelo and brought to life in collaboration with Nick L (c64-dev).

CRT THEME:
Originally based on the Carbon theme by Eric Hettervik; and then rebuilt by Alphatoanant.
